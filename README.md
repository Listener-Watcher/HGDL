# HGDL implementation

## data for DBLP and YELP dataset is too large to upload in the github. The dataset is stored in the OneDrive. Due to the anonymous requirement, the link will be posted later.


Quick run for HGDL_KL
python main_HGDL.py --dataset acm
Quick run for HAN_KL
python main_HAN.py --dataset acm
Quick run for SeHGNN_KL
python main_SeHGNN.py --dataset acm
